One of the more interesting findings that we see here is in the HvyAlcoholConsump data set. Those who do not drink heavily have a larger percentage of diabetes than those who do drink heavily. There are also some findings that are inline with what we would expect. For example, 22% of individuals with high cholesterol also have diabetes, whereas only ~8% of individuals without high cholesterol have diabetes.\nNow, let’s look at the categorical variables that have more than two levels. We will first look at the age variable. Let us do the same thing we did above, but as bar plots. We will see how the percentages of people with diabetes changes across the different age groups.\n\nageTable &lt;- table(diabetesCat$Age, diabetesCat$Diabetes_binary) |&gt;\n  as.data.frame()\n\ncolnames(ageTable) &lt;- c(\"Age\", \"Diabetes\", \"Count\")\n\nageTable &lt;- ageTable |&gt;\n  group_by(Age) |&gt;\n  mutate(Percentage = Count / sum(Count) * 100) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nggplot(ageTable, aes(x = Age, y = Percentage, fill = Diabetes)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(x = \"Age Category\", y = \"Percentage\",\n       title = \"Percentage of Individuals with Diabetes for each Age Group\",\n       fill = \"Diabetes\") \n\n\n\n\nFrom this graph, we can see that as the age category increases, a larger percentage of individuals have Diabetes. Now, let us investigate the General Health variable the same way:\n\ngenHlthTable &lt;- table(diabetesCat$GenHlth, diabetesCat$Diabetes_binary) |&gt;\n  as.data.frame()\n\ncolnames(genHlthTable) &lt;- c(\"GenHlth\", \"Diabetes\", \"Count\")\n\ngenHlthTable &lt;- genHlthTable |&gt;\n  group_by(GenHlth) |&gt;\n  mutate(Percentage = Count / sum(Count) * 100) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nggplot(genHlthTable, aes(x = GenHlth, y = Percentage, fill = Diabetes)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(x = \"General Health Category\", y = \"Percentage\",\n       title = \"Percentage of Individuals with Diabetes for each General Health Group\",\n       fill = \"Diabetes\") \n\n\n\n\nThis also tells us that as our general health get’s worse, the percentage of people with diabetes increases. For the last plot, let us explore the Physical Health variable:\n\nphysHlthTable &lt;- table(diabetesCat$PhysHlth, diabetesCat$Diabetes_binary) |&gt;\n  as.data.frame()\n\ncolnames(physHlthTable) &lt;- c(\"PhysHlth\", \"Diabetes\", \"Count\")\n\nphysHlthTable &lt;- physHlthTable |&gt;\n  group_by(PhysHlth) |&gt;\n  mutate(Percentage = Count / sum(Count) * 100) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nggplot(physHlthTable, aes(x = PhysHlth, y = Percentage, fill = Diabetes)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(x = \"Physical Health Category\", y = \"Percentage\",\n       title = \"Percentage of Individuals with Diabetes for each Physical Health Group\",\n       fill = \"Diabetes\") \n\n\n\n\nThe pattern in this plot is not as noticeable as the others, but we can still see that has the number of days where your physical health was not good, the percentages of having diabetes increase."
